🌊 Rinse Programming Language

“Noiseless. Hapless. Zero-cost. Progressive Process.”

---

## 🔹 Phase 1 – Core Compiler Skeleton (Python)

Directory layout (as you already drafted):

```
Rinse/
 ├─ src/
 │   ├─ lexer.py
 │   ├─ parser.py
 │   ├─ ast_dgm.py
 │   ├─ ir_gen.py
 │   ├─ nasm_gen.py
 │   └─ rinsec.py
 ├─ starbox/
 ├─ stdlib/
 │   ├─ io.rn
 │   ├─ net.rn
 │   └─ math.rn
 └─ tests/
```

### `lexer.py`

Tokenizes `.rn` code:

* Keywords: `init`, `item`, `flow`, `process`, `parallel`, `let`, `print`, `is`
* Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`
* Literals: ints, strings
* Symbols: `{`, `}`, `(`, `)`, `:` , `,`

### `parser.py`

Turns tokens into dodecagram-tagged AST nodes (from `ast_dgm.py`).

### `ast_dgm.py`

Defines node classes with **base-12 tags**:

* `0` → Program
* `1` → Block
* `2` → Statement
* `3` → Expression
* etc. (per your mapping)

### `ir_gen.py`

Translates AST → LLVM IR using `llvmlite`.

### `nasm_gen.py`

Takes LLVM IR → NASM `.asm` code.

### `rinsec.py`

CLI driver:

```bash
rinsec hello.rn -o hello.exe
```

---

## 🔹 Phase 2 – VESE (Virtual Execution Simulated Environment)

Instead of running on the host, `.exe` is a containerized VESE binary:

* Register-based model
* Immutable opcode execution
* Built-in checkpoints
* Parallel execution lanes
* Error handling at block scope

Prototype this with a **Python VM** that interprets the NASM-like output.

---

## 🔹 Phase 3 – Starbox Package Manager

* `starbox init` → creates `starbox.lock` (dodecagram lockfile).
* `starbox add io` → pulls standard lib package into VESE sandbox.

---

## 🔹 Phase 4 – rinsefmt Formatter

* Enforces **dualistic spacing** and **parametric indentation**.
* Guarantees “superior elegance formatting.”

---

## Example Flow

Input (`main.rn`):

```rinse
init main {
    let x: int = 12
    let y: int = 30
    print(x + y)
}
```

Run:

```bash
rinsec main.rn -o main.exe
```

Execution (inside VESE):

```
42
```

# 🔹 Paradigms in Rinse

Rinse is **not bound to one traditional paradigm** — instead, it integrates several layers:

1. **Progressive-Process-Oriented (PPO)**

   * Code is written as explicit **processes** (`flow`, `effect`, `parallel {}`) that compose.
   * Programs feel like *sequences of logical actions*, not OOP classes or imperative scripts.

2. **Item-Oriented Programming (IOP)**

   * Everything is an **item** (structs, arrays, tuples, ADTs, functions).
   * Items can carry fields, methods, and effects, but stay composable.
   * Think of it as “objects without the class boilerplate.”

3. **Functional Programming (FP)**

   * First-class functions, recursion, higher-order functions.
   * Pattern matching, algebraic data types, immutability-first.
   * Monads, monad transformers, and algebraic effects unify side effects.

4. **Algebraic Effect System**

   * Effects (`IO`, `State`, `Reader`, `Writer`, `Async`) are declared, invoked, and handled.
   * Unlike Haskell (monads everywhere), effects in Rinse are **direct syntax**:

     ```rinse
     effect IO {
         print("Hello")
         let x = read()
         return x
     }
     ```

5. **Structured Concurrency**

   * Native `async`, `await`, `parallel {}` — built on VESE tasks.
   * No “naked threads”: concurrency is scoped and deterministic.

6. **Declarative + Compositional**

   * Programs describe *what to do*, VESE schedules *how to run*.
   * Algebraic effects + handlers replace explicit plumbing.

# 🔹 Handling of Instances in Rinse (VESE Model)

Rinse runs **entirely inside VESE (Virtual Execution Simulated Environment)**.
This means all **instances** (variables, structs, arrays, ADTs, effects) are **VESE-managed items**.

1. **Strict Virtual Register Model**

   * No dangling pointers, no nulls.
   * Every value lives in a virtual register or memory cell.
   * Example:

     ```rinse
     let x: int = 42   # x lives in VESE register
     ```

2. **Instances of Structs / Tuples / Enums**

   * Internally stored as **VESE dictionaries** with tags:

     ```json
     { "__type__": "Person", "name": "Alice", "age": 30 }
     ```
   * Pattern matching destructures these instances safely.

3. **Instance Mutation**

   * Allowed through **explicit field assignment**:

     ```rinse
     p.age = 31
     ```
   * VESE ensures **serial scoped mutation** (no leaks across scopes).

4. **Instance Lifecycle in Effects**

   * In `State` effects, instances represent evolving state values.
   * In `IO`, instances encapsulate side-effect results (via closures).
   * In `Async`, instances become **tasks/fibers** (`Task { run, result }`).

5. **Garbage + Reuse**

   * VESE uses **gapless compression**: arrays/lists auto-shrink, tuples compact.
   * Freed instances are recycled into the VESE heap.
   * No user memory management required.

6. **Polymorphic Instances (Generics)**

   * ADTs like `Option<T>` or `List<T>` instantiate with real type args.
   * VESE maintains the type tag for safety:

     ```json
     { "__enum__": "Option", "__variant__": "Some", "fields": [42] }
     ```

7. **Effect Instances**

   * Each `effect` block creates an **effect instance** managed by VESE.
   * Handlers wrap/override how these instances execute.
   * Example:

     ```rinse
     handle Console with { case print(msg) { core_print(msg) } } run { ... }
     ```

     Here, `print(msg)` produces an **effect instance**, and the handler interprets it.

---

# 🔹 Performance Model

* **Intrinsically Native-Speed Runtime**:
  Rinse transpiles `SRC → LLVM IR → NASM → .exe`, but execution occurs in VESE (sandboxed).
* **Optimizations**:

  * Zero-cost: constant folding, loop unrolling, vectorization, tail calls.
  * Gapless data: arrays compress automatically, avoiding fragmentation.
* **Concurrency**:
  VESE tasks are **fibers** (lightweight threads), scheduled cooperatively.
* **Determinism**:
  Even async/parallel execution is *deterministic*, since VESE orders results consistently.

---

✅ In short:

**Paradigms:**

* Progressive-Process-Oriented
* Item-Oriented
* Functional (monads, ADTs, recursion)
* Algebraic Effects & Handlers
* Structured Concurrency

**Instance Handling:**

* All items (structs, arrays, ADTs, effects) are VESE-managed, gapless, type-safe.
* Instances are stored in **typed virtual registers**.
* Effects wrap instances into **effectful tasks**.
* No nulls, no dangling pointers, no leaks.

# 🔹 Who Will Use Rinse?

1. **Systems Programmers**

   * People who would normally pick **C, Rust, or Zig** but want **safety + algebraic effects + structured concurrency**.
   * They need **native binaries** but want to avoid segfaults and dangling pointers.

2. **Application Developers**

   * Teams that would pick **Go, Java, or TypeScript** for backend services but want **effect handlers + async + type safety** with **lower boilerplate**.

3. **Academics & Researchers**

   * Anyone exploring **algebraic effects, language design, or concurrency models**.
   * Rinse provides a **practical playground** for theory-driven features (monads, ADTs, effect handlers).

4. **Data & AI Engineers**

   * Because of the **parallel/async model**, Rinse is suitable for **matrix ops, distributed workloads, ML pipelines**.

5. **Cross-industry Engineers**

   * Security-focused sectors (finance, defense).
   * High-performance sectors (telecom, simulation, games).
   * Emerging sectors (edge devices, AR/VR runtimes).

---

# 🔹 What It Will Be Used For

* **Operating System Services** (safe kernels, sandboxes, schedulers).
* **Distributed Systems** (microservices, message brokers).
* **Compilers/Interpreters** (effect-driven transformations).
* **Game Engines** (structured concurrency + deterministic parallelism).
* **Data Science Pipelines** (async + algebraic effects for ML).
* **High-assurance Applications** (finance, aerospace, medical).

---

# 🔹 Learning Curve

* **Beginner-friendly**:
  Syntax is clean, similar to modern scripting languages (`flow`, `item`, `parallel {}`).
* **Intermediate**:
  Once users learn **items, flows, effects**, they can code like in Python or Go.
* **Advanced**:
  Algebraic effect handlers and ADTs have a steeper curve (like Haskell/OCaml).

👉 Expectation: **Python → Rinse in 2 weeks**; **C → Rinse in 1 month**.

---

# 🔹 Interoperability

* **C ABI / FFI built-in**

  ```rinse
  import c "math.h"
  let x = c::sqrt(49)
  ```
* **Python bridging**

  ```rinse
  import python "numpy"
  ```
* **HTML/JS interop** for embedded apps.
* Future-ready for **WASM export**.

✅ This makes it more interoperable than Rust (easier FFI) and more direct than Go (which hides FFI).

---

# 🔹 Use Cases (Including Edge Cases)

* **Safe system tools**: compilers, interpreters, VM monitors.
* **Async services**: chat servers, distributed loggers.
* **Simulation**: physics engines, robotics.
* **Security-critical apps**: zero-dangling pointers, sandboxed execution.
* **Edge computing**: IoT runtimes where determinism matters.
* **Research**: language semantics, effect algebra, concurrency models.

Edge cases:

* Symbolic differentiation (already supported).
* Proof blocks for formal verification.
* Deep recursion with ADTs (trees, linked lists).

---

# 🔹 What Can Rinse Do Now?

✅ Parse → AST (dodecagram base-12) → LLVM IR → NASM → `.exe`.
✅ Run programs inside VESE with **real execution** (arithmetic, functions, ADTs, pattern matching, recursion).
✅ Handle **loops, recursion, structs, tuples, arrays, nested arrays**.
✅ Execute **effects** (IO, State, Reader, Writer).
✅ Execute **async/parallel tasks** deterministically.
✅ Support **algebraic effect handlers** for custom side effects.
